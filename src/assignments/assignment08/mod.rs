//! Assignment 8: First-class functions.
//!
//! The primary goal of this assignment is to get used to first-class functions.
//!
//! You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that `/scripts/grade.sh 8` works
//! fine. See `assignment08/*_grade.rs` and `/scripts/grade.sh 8` for the test script.
//!
//! To submit, run
//! ```bash
//! # At the cs220 home directory,
//! ./scripts/submit.sh
//! ```
//! and submit the generated `assignment08.zip` file in `target` directory.
