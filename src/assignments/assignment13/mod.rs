//! Assignment 13: Parallelism.
//!
//! The primary goal of this assignment is to get used to data parallelism.
//!
//! Refer to your solution for assignment 09. You will implement the parallelized version of
//! assignment 09. You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that
//! `/scripts/grade.sh 13` works fine. See `assignment13/small_exercises_grade.rs` and
//! `/scripts/grade.sh 13` for the test script.
//!
//! To submit, run
//! ```bash
//! # At the cs220 home directory,
//! ./scripts/submit.sh
//! ```
//! and submit the generated `assignment13.zip` file in `target` directory.
