//! Assignment 2: Mastering common programming concepts (1/2).
//!
//! The primary goal of this assignment is to re-learn the common programming concepts in Rust, especially those in the Rust Book chapters 3 and 5.
//! Please make sure you're comfortable with the concepts to proceed on to the next assignments.
//!
//! You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that `/scripts/grade.sh 2` works fine.
//! See `assigment02/*_grade.rs` and `/scripts/grade.sh 2` for the test script.
//!
//! To submit, run
//! ```bash
//! # At the cs220 home directory,
//! ./scripts/submit.sh
//! ```
//! and submit the generated `assignment02.zip` file in `target` directory.
