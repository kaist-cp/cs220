//! Assignment 1: Preparing Rust Development Environment.
//!
//! The primary goal of this assignment is bringing up SSH, VSCode, and all the other necessary
//! tools to develop Rust programs. Please make sure you're comfortable with developing Rust
//! programs before moving on to the next assignments.
//!
//! You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that `/scripts/grade.sh 1` works
//! fine. See `assigment01/small_exercises_grade.rs` and `/scripts/grade.sh 1` for the test script.
//!
//! To submit, run
//! ```bash
//! # At the cs220 home directory,
//! ./scripts/submit.sh
//! ```
//! and submit the generated `assignment01.zip` file in `target` directory.
