//! A small graph library.
//!
//! A node has a i32 value and (directed) edges to other nodes. A node does not have multiple edges
//! to the same node. Nodes are not associated with a particular domain, and users can freely
//! create nodes however they like. However, after a node is created, it can be added to a
//! `SubGraph`, which form a subgraph of the graph of all nodes. A node can be added to multiple
//! subgraphs. `SubGraph` has a method to check if the it has a cycle.
//!
//! The goal of this assignment is to learn how to deal with inherently shared mutable data in
//! Rust. Design the types and fill in the `todo!()`s in methods. There are several possible
//! approaches to this problem and you may import anything from the std library accordingly.
