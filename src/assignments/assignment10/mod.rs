//! Assignment 10: Iterators (2/2).
//! The primary goal of this assignment is to get used to iterators.
//!
//! You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that `/scripts/grade.sh 10` works
//! fine. See `assignment10/*_grade.rs` and `/scripts/grade.sh 10` for the test script.
//!
//! To submit, run
//! ```bash
//! # At the cs220 home directory,
//! ./scripts/submit.sh
//! ```
//! and submit the generated `assignment10.zip` file in `target` directory.
