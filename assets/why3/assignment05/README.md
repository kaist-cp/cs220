# Assignment 5: Program correctness and logic

* The primary goal of this assignment is to grasp basic concepts about proving a program's correctness with deductive reasoning.

* You should fill in `TODO`s in three files: `max.mlw`, `binary_search.mlw`, `pascal.mlw`.

* You may use [Why3 in your browser](https://why3.lri.fr/try/). 
  * Clicking `Verify` button at the top will open a panel on the right side.
  * For each task in the panel (e.g. `loop invariant preservation`), you can right-click it and run the prover.
  * Fill in `TODO`s until the prover can verify all tasks, notified with green check-marks.

* To submit your solution, run `./scripts/submit.sh` and submit `assignment05.zip` in the `target` directory to gg.
